# Pythons

[![Build and Push](https://github.com/lukewiwa/pythons/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/lukewiwa/pythons/actions/workflows/build.yml)

A docker container that has the following latest versions of python installed:

- 3.6
- 3.7
- 3.8
- 3.9

These are the most up to date minor versions of currently supported python installations. The purpose of this container is mostly for testing and **not intended for deployment**. A typical use case is running tox tests against multiple versions of python both locally and in CI.
